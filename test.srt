5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,359
When you kick a soccer ball, the energy

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,199
you expend in moving your foot is

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
transferred to the movement or kinetic

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,640
energy of the soccer ball. Some of this

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,719
energy is also expended in the form of

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,960
heat and sound. But if you were to add

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,960
up all the energy from the start to

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,679
finish, you would find that the total

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,839
energy did not change. This rule applies

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,558
to everything. No matter how you

16
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,960
transfer or transform energy, kicking a

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,759
soccer ball, driving a car, lighting a

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,320
candle, the total amount of energy stays

19
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,799
constant overall. The same goes for

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,600
momentum. When objects collide, their

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,839
momentum just gets passed around. These

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
are examples of conservation laws in

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,039
physics, and they're probably the most

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,120
fundamental principles we know of. But

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,160
what's even more fascinating is why

26
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:01,519
these laws hold true. Turns out that

27
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:04,558
each conservation law is tied to a deep

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
symmetry in nature. This connection was

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,840
first uncovered by mathematician Emmy

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,040
Neiter and it's one of the most

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,359
beautiful ideas in physics. If nature's

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,159
laws have a certain symmetry, then

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,840
something will be conserved always. In

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,240
this video, I'll break down the three

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,079
major conservation laws and show you why

36
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,879
and how they reveal a fundamental

37
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,679
symmetry in the universe and how Niter's

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,920
genius helped uncover some of the

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
deepest secrets of reality. You don't

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,790
want to miss this because that's coming

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
up right now.

42
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,079
[Music]

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's start with the three major

44
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,719
conservation laws. These are the VIPs of

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,759
physics that never break as long as

46
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,478
nothing from the outside interferes. The

47
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,239
first is conservation of energy. Energy

48
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,719
cannot be created out of nothing nor

49
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,640
destroyed to nothingness. It can only

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,039
change form. For example, chemical

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,359
energy in fuel turns into kinetic energy

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
of a car which turns into heat and so

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,840
on. But if you add it all up, the total

54
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,679
energy stays the same. This rule, the

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,239
first law of thermodynamics is

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,719
absolutely fundamental. The second is

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,039
conservation of momentum. There's linear

58
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,039
and angular. Both are important, but for

59
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,280
simplicity, I'll talk about linear

60
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,840
momentum. Just know that the same

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,400
principle applies to the total spin of a

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,959
system. Momentum is the product of mass

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,280
times velocity. You can think of it as

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
how much something is moving. Heavier

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,598
things moving faster have more momentum

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,598
than lighter things moving slower. In an

67
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,439
isolated system, the total momentum

68
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,759
remains constant. When playing

69
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,560
billiards, for example, when the Q ball

70
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,759
hits object balls, its momentum is

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,840
transferred. If you added up the mass

72
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,000
times velocity of all the balls before

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,680
and after the collision, it would remain

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,318
the same. The third is conservation of

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
electric charge. The total charge of a

76
00:02:56,318 --> 00:03:00,719
system remains the same. Charge can be

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
transferred but not created or

78
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,519
destroyed. So for example in a chemical

79
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,840
reaction when one molecule gains a

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
negative charge due to the transfer of

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,120
an electron the other molecule gains a

82
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,039
positive charge. Total charge remains

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
the same in an isolated system. You

84
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,479
can't create charge out of nothing.

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,640
These are the big ones energy momentum

86
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,878
and charge. There are other conservation

87
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:27,359
laws like conservation of leptton number

88
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,679
or berion number in particle physics or

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,239
the combined conservation of mass energy

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,080
which merges mass and energy together.

91
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,158
But the three above are considered the

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
bedrock conservation laws that apply

93
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,560
across a huge range of physical

94
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,439
phenomena. They were discovered by

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,840
observing that nothing ever seemed to

96
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,759
violate them. No one ever saw energy

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
just pop into existence or disappear.

98
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:55,359
For example, for a long time they were

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
just how nature works. But that wasn't a

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
fully satisfying answer. It felt like

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
there must be a reason why these

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
quantities are the ones that nature

103
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,798
chooses to keep constant. And that's

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,799
where symmetry enters the story. What is

105
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
the meaning of symmetry? When we hear

106
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
symmetry, we think of visual patterns

107
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,878
like a butterfly with matching left and

108
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,759
right wings, a perfectly round

109
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,759
snowflake, or letters like H and O that

110
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,240
look the same in a mirror.

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,000
In everyday language, symmetry means a

112
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,400
change that leaves something looking the

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,319
same. If you rotate a snowflake, it

114
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,719
lines up with itself again. That's

115
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,040
rotational symmetry. In physics, we

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,520
extend this idea to the laws of nature.

117
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
A symmetry means that when you make a

118
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,560
change or transformation in a system,

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
the governing laws or equations do not

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,639
change. It's an invariance. For example,

121
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,799
imagine you perform an experiment today

122
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
and then the exact same experiment

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,439
tomorrow. If the laws of physics are

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,918
time symmetric, the results should be

125
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,680
identical. That is the underlying rules

126
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:02,159
don't care when you do the experiment.

127
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,720
This is a symmetry in time or time

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,039
translation symmetry. Likewise, if you

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
do an experiment in New York City and

130
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,360
then do the same thing in Beijing, you

131
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,519
will get the same outcome if conditions

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,000
are the same. This tells us that the

133
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,478
laws of physics are symmetric in space.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,038
They don't care where you are. No

135
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,399
particular location in the universe has

136
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,038
special physics. That's spatial or space

137
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,758
translation symmetry. Just like a mirror

138
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,639
image or rotated shape can be invariant

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,280
in appearance, a physical process can be

140
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,840
invariant in its outcomes under a shift

141
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,839
in time or space. Physicists and

142
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,879
mathematicians say the system is

143
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,478
invariant under that transformation.

144
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,680
But here's the key insight that was

145
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:49,839
proven by Emmy Noer around 1918.

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
Whenever you have such a symmetry,

147
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,399
something must be conserved. It's now

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
called Niter's theorem. Stated

149
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,879
informally, the theorem says for every

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,879
continuous symmetry of a physical

151
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,680
system, there's a corresponding

152
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,839
conserved quantity. So, what properties

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
are conserved with time and space

154
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,719
translation symmetry? Time translation

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,879
symmetry leads to conservation of energy

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,199
and space translation symmetry leads to

157
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,279
conservation of momentum. Similarly,

158
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
something called gauge symmetry leads to

159
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,000
conservation of electric charge. This is

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,400
a more complicated concept, but I will

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
add this as a bonus at the end of the

162
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,638
video if you really want to dive into

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,199
the nitty-gritty of quantum physics. Let

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
me first address the question I posed in

165
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,160
the title of this video by thoroughly

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,400
explaining how time translation symmetry

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
leads to energy conservation. Then I'll

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,758
explain the other two conserved

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
quantities. First, you should know that

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
energy is a kind of currency in the

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,639
universe. It can make things move, heat

172
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,080
things up, create light, or even hold

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,879
things together. Energy can switch forms

174
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,599
from motion to heat, like the brakes in

175
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,759
your car, from electricity to sound like

176
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,840
the speakers in your headphones. But it

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,280
can't disappear or appear out of

178
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,758
nowhere. But imagine if this was not the

179
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,079
case. Imagine what it would mean if

180
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
energy was not conserved. If energy

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,639
suddenly appeared out of nowhere, it

182
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
would mean there was a special moment in

183
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,598
time when extra energy was created,

184
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,840
breaking the idea that the rules of the

185
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,240
universe are constant over time. If

186
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,478
energy suddenly disappeared, again,

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,960
there would be a special moment in time

188
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,879
where the rules changed. In other words,

189
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,519
changing energy would mean the universe

190
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,759
has special moments where the rules

191
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,038
shift, making things different today

192
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,759
than yesterday. But since we see that

193
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:44,879
the universe's rules don't change from

194
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,520
moment to moment, that is we have time

195
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,519
symmetry, the universe can't have these

196
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,598
special moments when energy is suddenly

197
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,318
appears or disappears. In other words,

198
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,878
if the rules stay the same, the universe

199
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,840
has no way to choose or suddenly find a

200
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,919
special moment in time to add or remove

201
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,519
energy. If energy appeared or

202
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,839
disappeared, that would mean the

203
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,918
universe was different at one moment

204
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,638
compared to another. But because the

205
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,799
universe is symmetrical in time, energy

206
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,918
must remain constant to keep the

207
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,478
symmetry true. Emmy Noer proved this

208
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,560
mathematically that time symmetry leads

209
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,399
directly to the universe conserving

210
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,240
energy. Now I'm going to address the

211
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,839
other two conserved quantities and how

212
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
they lead to conservation of momentum

213
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,839
and electric charge. As I said earlier,

214
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,439
space translation symmetry means that

215
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,199
the laws of physics are the same in New

216
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,599
York as they are in Beijing, as they are

217
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,759
in your house. They're the same in the

218
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,479
Milky Way galaxy as they are in the

219
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,639
Andromeda galaxy. For illustration,

220
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
let's use an example of two people in a

221
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,759
boat on still waters. If one throws a

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,759
basketball to the other, what happens?

223
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,000
The momentum of the basketball is

224
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,319
transferred to the movement of the two

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,879
boats. They both move away from each

226
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,720
other. If we did calculations, we would

227
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,080
find that the total momentum of the

228
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
basketball was transferred to the boats.

229
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,759
There is some friction of the water in

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
the real world, which we're going to

231
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,559
ignore for simplicity. But imagine if

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,879
this were not the case. What if momentum

233
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,359
was not conserved? What if suddenly the

234
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,600
momentum changed for no reason? Like one

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,759
of the boats started moving with no push

236
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
of any kind. This would mean that

237
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,439
something changed in the laws of the

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,159
universe depending on where the boats

239
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
are located in the water. But space

240
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,039
translation symmetry says that the rules

241
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,639
can't depend on your position. The rules

242
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:37,039
are the same whether you are here or 3 m

243
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:39,519
away. In other words, if momentum were

244
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,519
not conserved, it would break the space

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
translation symmetry. It would imply

246
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
that there's a special place in the

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
universe where momentum can appear or go

248
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,039
away. But translation symmetry forbids

249
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,759
this. Therefore, momentum must stay

250
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,360
constant. Very similarly, rotational

251
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,080
symmetry leads to conservation of

252
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,240
angular momentum as well. Now, let's

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,720
look at gauge symmetry leading to the

254
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,200
conservation of charge. This one is a

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
bit more abstract. So, I'll start with a

256
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,160
simple analogy and then we'll go deeper.

257
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,000
What's your height? Let's say you tell

258
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,480
me that you are 5' 8 in tall. What is

259
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,879
the zero height? Are you measuring this

260
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,200
height from the floor of your house? Are

261
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,559
you measuring it from sea level? Or are

262
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,480
you measuring it from the center of the

263
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,159
earth? If you measure your height from

264
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,240
the floor of your house, it would be a

265
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,639
different number than if you measured it

266
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,039
from sea level. And much different than

267
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,759
the number from the center of the earth.

268
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,559
But changing the place you call zero

269
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,200
height doesn't actually change how tall

270
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,879
you really are, does it? You just chose

271
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
a different reference for what you

272
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,078
called zero height. This choice of

273
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,720
starting point is what scientists call

274
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,799
gauge choice. Let's take this analogy

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,278
into the physics of electricity. In

276
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,759
electricity, instead of height, we

277
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,159
measure something called potential. It's

278
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,559
kind of like the electric height for

279
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,039
charges. Charges move from higher

280
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:08,078
electric potential to lower ones, just

281
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,958
like water flows downhill. But just like

282
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:14,159
the height example, the place you choose

283
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,838
as zero electric potential is up to you.

284
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,519
You can choose any reference point you

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
want. You could choose the negative side

286
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,320
of a battery as zero or you could choose

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,958
the positive side of a battery as zero.

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,200
When you change the zero point, the

289
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,119
number for potential will be shifted

290
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,680
everywhere in the universe. But even

291
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,919
though the numbers have changed, the

292
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,399
behavior of charges and electricity will

293
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,360
remain exactly the same. This

294
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,120
flexibility to choose the zero point for

295
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,519
electric potential without affecting

296
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,078
real physics is what we call gauge

297
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,078
symmetry. Now, how does this freedom to

298
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,319
choose your reference, the gauge

299
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,519
symmetry, lead to electric charge

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,680
conservation? Here's how. Gauge symmetry

301
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
says you can shift your potential, your

302
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,919
zero point, however you want, and

303
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,078
nothing physically real changes. If this

304
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,639
were not the case, it would mean that

305
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,439
electric charge could just appear or

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,759
vanish randomly and the electric field

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,000
patterns would change unpredictably.

308
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,639
That means suddenly your choice of zero

309
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,839
point would matter. It would affect

310
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,240
reality breaking gauge symmetry. But

311
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,480
gauge symmetry is fundamental. It's

312
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,879
built into how electric and magnetic

313
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
fields work. Nature never breaks this

314
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,120
symmetry.

315
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,839
So electric charges can't simply appear

316
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,720
or disappear randomly. The total amount

317
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,720
must always remain constant and this is

318
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
called conservation of charge. In other

319
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,240
words, gauge symmetry forces charges to

320
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,879
behave in a consistent predictable way,

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,799
never popping in or out of existence.

322
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,838
Charges can move around, but the

323
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,159
universe's total charge stays constant.

324
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,120
Your choice of zero point for potential

325
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,120
doesn't change real physical events. In

326
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,078
each of these cases, Niter's theorem

327
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,720
elevates what once were just observed

328
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,519
facts to something deeper, a logical

329
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,759
consequence of symmetry. Before Niter,

330
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,240
conservation laws were kind of

331
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,879
mysterious random principles confirmed

332
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,519
by experiments but never explained.

333
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,838
After Noer, we understand that they are

334
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,000
demanded by certain symmetries. So, we

335
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,560
can understand where they come from at a

336
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,120
fundamental level. No wonder Einstein

337
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,759
praised her as the most significant

338
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,679
creative mathematical genius. And if you

339
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,679
want to be a mathematical genius, too, a

340
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,599
